It only worked some of the time and was super slow. I could see myself using this in the middle of a show to play and pause, but right now I wouldn't use it to navigate a menu.",Moving!

3/31/2023 18:20:05,You don't have to keep track of a remote,2,Better recognition so you don't have to do the gesture multiple times before it recognizes what you're doing,The rewind was challenging and the back was extremely difficult to recognize,,,,,,,,,
4/8/2023 12:32:59,Its an interesting concept in theory but for me personally it came up short.,2,"I would check to see if the classification can recognize both right and left hands. I noticed that when Tyson would use his left hand it picked up the gestures better. Also I would try to add a window/area of effect for certain gestures like the ""back"" and ""rewind/fast-forward"" gesture.   

Tyson's comments: it recognized his palm as ""ok"", which was a really big challenge. One cause here could be that the user is African American. Previously I had 3 Asian friends play around with it with no issues.","I had trouble with the ""back"" gesture and ""select"" gesture. I believe both gestures weren't able to properly be recognized.

Oh, also, was there a command for controlling volume? That might be useful.

Tyson's comments: NEW CODE","See above. Moving your hand horizontally with your thumb tucked in put pressure on my wrist tendon, but I think that's more on me than on the controls.",18,13,3,2,Aerospace Engineerng,,,,
